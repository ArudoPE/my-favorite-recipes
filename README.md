# My favorite Recipes Project

In this project, I'm using all I learned from HTML, from the boilerplate to links and images.

*02/22/22 Update
- I added basic CSS styles for the index.html and the recipes pages.
- I added a new image on the index.html.
- I improved the structure using semantic HTML (header, main, footer, and section tags).

*02/24/22 Update
- Renamed to "My Favorite Recipes".

*02/25/22 Update
- Change from display block to display flex on the main page.
- Invert text and background color (background now white and text black).
- Added a new main image.
- Added a new name as logo and a basic header menu.
- Added basic responsive for mobile (hide nav menu on mobile).

*03/15/22 Update
- Made reset, shared, header, and footer separated components to be able to reuse them by using import on CSS.
- Removed underline from links on desktop view.
- Created a new folder for JavaScript code and a script.js empty file.
- Added basic OG tags for image preview and general info to work with: Facebook, Twitter and Whatsapp.
- Created empty new pages for every kind of recipe.

*I'll keep improving this project.
