Odin Recipes Web

In this project I'm using all I learned from HTML, from the boilerplate to links an images.

*02/22/22 Update
- I added basic CSS styles for the index.html and the recipes pages.
- I added a new image on the index.html.
- I improved the structure using semantic HTML (header,main,footer and section tags).

*I'll keep improving this project.
